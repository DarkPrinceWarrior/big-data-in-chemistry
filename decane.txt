When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Rats were exposed to decane vapors at time-weighted average concentrations of 1200, 781, or 273 ppm in a 32-L Leach chamber for 4 hr. Time-course samples for 1200 ppm and end-of-exposure samples for 781 and 273 ppm decane exposures were collected from blood, brain, liver, fat, bone marrow, lung, skin, and spleen. The pharmacokinetics of decane could not be described by flow-limited assumptions and measured in vitro tissue/air partition coefficients. A refined PBPK model for decane was then developed using flow-limited (liver and lung) and diffusion-limited (brain, bone marrow, fat, skin, and spleen) equations to describe the uptake and clearance of decane in the blood and tissues. Partition coefficient values for blood/air and tissue/blood were estimated by fitting end-of-exposure pharmacokinetic data and assumed to reflect the available decane for rapid exchange with blood. A portion of decane is speculated to be sequestered in \"deep\" pools in the body, unavailable for rapid exchange with blood. PBPK model predictions were adequate in describing the tissues and blood kinetics. For model validation, the refined PBPK model for decane had mixed successes at predicting tissue and blood concentrations for lower concentrations of decane vapor, suggesting that further improvements in the model may be necessary to extrapolate to lower concentrations.",

The blood:air PC values for n-C8 to n-C12 were 3.1, 5.8, 8.1, 20.4, and 24.6, respectively. The lipid solubility of n-alkanes increases with carbon length, suggesting that lipid solubility is an important determinant in describing n-alkane blood:air PC values. The muscle:blood, liver: blood, brain:blood, and fat:blood PC values were octane (1.0, 1.9, 1.4, and 247), nonane (0.8, 1.9, 3.8, and 274), decane (0.9, 2.0, 4.8, and 328), undecane (0.7, 1.5, 1.7, and 529), and dodecane (1.2, 1.9, 19.8, and 671), respectively. The tissue:blood PC values were greatest in fat and the least in muscle. The brain:air PC value for undecane was inconsistent with other n-alkane values. Using the measured partition coefficient values of these n-alkanes, linear regression was used to predict tissue (except brain) and blood:air partition coefficient values for larger n-alkanes, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and heptadecane (n-C13 to n-C17). Good agreement between measured and predicted tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficient values for n-C8 to n-Cl2 offer confidence in the partition coefficient predictions for longer chain n-alkanes.",

One of these is S-8, a replacement jet fuel synthesized using the Fischer-Tropsch process, which contains no aromatic compounds and is mainly composed of straight and branched alkanes. Metabolites of S-8 fuel in laboratory animals have not been identified. The goal of this study was to identify metabolic products from exposure to aerosolized S-8 and a designed straight-chain alkane/polyaromatic mixture (decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, naphthalene, and 2-methylnaphthalene) in male Fischer 344 rats. Collected blood and tissue samples were analyzed for 70 straight and branched alcohols and ketones ranging from 7 to 15 carbons. No fuel metabolites were observed in the blood, lungs, brain, and fat following S-8 exposure. Metabolites were detected in the liver, urine, and feces. Most of the metabolites were 2- and 3-position alcohols and ketones of prominent hydrocarbons with very few 1- or 4-position metabolites. Following exposure to the alkane mixture, metabolites were observed in the blood, liver, and lungs. Interestingly, heavy metabolites (3-tridecanone, 2-tridecanol, and 2-tetradecanol) were observed only in the lung tissues possibly indicating that metabolism occurred in the lungs. With the exception of these heavy metabolites, the metabolic profiles observed in this study are consistent with previous studies reporting on the metabolism of individual alkanes. Further work is needed to determine the potential metabolic interactions of parent, primary, and secondary metabolites and identify more polar metabolites. Some metabolites may have potential use as biomarkers of exposure to fuels.",

The aim of this study was to determine in vitro metabolic rate constants for semivolatile n-alkanes, nonane (C9), decane (C10), and tetradecane (C14), by rat liver microsomal oxidation. The metabolism was assessed by measuring the disappearance of parent compound by gas chromatography. Various concentrations of n-alkanes were incubated with liver microsomes from adult male F-344 rats. Nonlinear kinetic constants for nonane and decane were V(max) (nmol/mg protein/min) = 7.26 +/- 0.20 and 2.80 +/- 0.35, respectively, and K(M) (micro M) = 294.83 +/- 68.67 and 398.70 +/- 42.70, respectively. Metabolic capacity as assessed by intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(M)) was approximately four-fold higher for nonane (0.03 +/- 0.005) than for decane (0.007 +/- 0.001). There was no appreciable metabolism of tetradecane even with higher microsomal protein concentration and longer incubation time. These results show a negative correlation between metabolic clearance and chain length of n-alkanes. These metabolic rate constants will be used to update existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for nonane and decane as part of developing a PBPK model for JP-8.",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

Use of water spray when fighting fire may be inefficient. CAUTION: For mixtures containing alcohol or polar solvent, alcohol-resistant foam may be more effective.  SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray or regular foam.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray, fog or regular foam. Avoid aiming straight or solid streams directly onto the product. If it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. For petroleum crude oil, do not spray water directly into a breached tank car. This can lead to a dangerous boil over. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2020)",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In tests with human subjects, solutions as strong as 30% produced no irritation when applied to skin and left for 24 hr. Decane is a simple asphyxiant and causes CNS depression in high concentrations. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rats exposed to decane vapor have been examined for lens opacities, but no cataracts were found. Rats exposed to 0.2 mL of decane by inhalation died within 24 hr by pulmonary edema and hemorrhaging. Decane is highly lipid-soluble and causes pulmonary pneumonitis when aspired into lungs. Animals showed signs of dyspnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis. In rats exposed by inhalation decane caused some limited, but statistically significant neurobehavioral effects at 5 g/cu m, with no effects at 1.5 g/cu m. Exposure of rats to 540 ppm of decane 18 hr/day, 7 days/week for 57 days stimulated weight gains and decreased the total white blood count, but no bone marrow changes or other organ changes were noted. Dermal application of undiluted decane to mice (0.1-0.15 g per mouse, 3 times a week for 50 weeks) caused fibrosis of the dermis, pigmentation, and some ulceration. Some animals also showed kidney effects and lung hemorrhaging. Mice treated with decane developed tumors on the backs, after exposure to ultraviolet radiation at wavelengths longer than 350 nm, generally considered noncarcinogenic. In rats no statistically significant treatment-related effects were observed at any dose level in any of the reproductive or developmental parameters. The following genotoxicity studies were negative: Ames assay - with and without metabolic activation - on Salmonella typhimurium; forward mutation on Chinese hamster (V79) lung cells; chromosomal aberrations cytogenetics assay on Chinese hamster (V79) lung cells; cell transformation and cotransformation with benzo(a)pyrene on Syrian hamster embryo cells; and intercellular communication on Syrian hamster embryo cells.",

In order to elucidate the dermatotoxicity of a complex mixture like jet fuels, structural differences, exposure time and dosage were investigated on HEK toxicity assessed by mortality and IL-8 release. ALI and ARO hydrocarbons were grouped into 4 categories: highly cytotoxic (octane, nonane, decane for aliphatics and cyclohexalbenzene, trimethylbenzene, xylene for aromatics), low cytotoxic (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene for aromatics), high IL-8 release (decane, undecane, dodecane for aliphatics and dimethylnapthalene, cyclohexylbenzene, ethylbenzene for aromatics) and low IL-8 release (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene, toluene, xylene for aromatics). The 4 categories of ALI hydrocarbons were mixed with each other, or cross-mixed with each of the 4 categories of ARO hydrocarbons. The resulting cytotoxicity and IL-8 production from HEK were evaluated at 24 hr. The results showed an antagonistic cytotoxic effect between ALI and ARO hydrocarbons in which ALI attenuated the degree of HEK mortality caused by the ARO hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the ARO hydrocarbons reduced the significant increase of IL-8 induced by ALI hydrocarbons. Synergistic effects between low IL-8 inductive and low cytotoxic hydrocarbons were found and the highest cytotoxic and IL-8 inductive responses did not completely correspond to the mixture of highly cytotoxic and highly IL-8 inductive hydrocarbons. This study supports the concept that the ARO dictate the degree of HEK mortality, while the ALI are the major contributor to inciting the proinflammatory response. Mixture effects must be considered when evaluating cytotoxicity to HEK.",

Maintain an open airway and assist ventilation if necessary. Administer supplemental oxygen. Monitor arterial blood gases or oximetry, chest radiographs, and ECG and admit symptomatic patients to an intensive care setting. Use epinephrine and other beta-adrenergic medications with caution in patients with significant hydrocarbon intoxication because arrhythmias may be induced. 2. Pulmonary aspiration. Patients who remain completely asymptomatic after 4-6 hours of observation may be discharged. In contrast, if the patient is coughing on arrival, aspiration probably has occurred. Administer supplemental oxygen and treat bronchospasm and hypoxia if they occur. Do not use steroids or prophylactic antibiotics. 3. Ingestion. In the vast majority of accidental childhood ingestions, less than 5-10 mL is actually swallowed and systemic toxicity is rare. Treatment is primarily supportive. Injection. For injections into the fingertip or hand, especially those involving a high-pressure paint gun, consult with a plastic or hand surgeon immediately, as prompt wide exposure, irrigation, and debridement are often required. /Hydrocarbons/",

The most significant findings were dose-dependent changes in irritation of mucous membranes, increased sensation of odor intensity, and reduced air quality. Adaptation was seen at the highest exposure levels, but not at the levels relevant for a non-industrial environment. The physiological measurements showed decreased tear film stability at all exposure concns. The number of conjunctival polymorphonuclear leucocytes increased in a dose-related manner. Predictors of the sensitivity to exposure, i.e. mucous membrane irritation threshold and skin irritation (Stingers test), were correlated to subjective ratings of odor intensity and irritation of mucous membranes. ...",

In order to elucidate the dermatotoxicity of a complex mixture like jet fuels, structural differences, exposure time and dosage were investigated on HEK toxicity assessed by mortality and IL-8 release. ALI and ARO hydrocarbons were grouped into 4 categories: highly cytotoxic (octane, nonane, decane for aliphatics and cyclohexalbenzene, trimethylbenzene, xylene for aromatics), low cytotoxic (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene for aromatics), high IL-8 release (decane, undecane, dodecane for aliphatics and dimethylnapthalene, cyclohexylbenzene, ethylbenzene for aromatics) and low IL-8 release (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene, toluene, xylene for aromatics). The 4 categories of ALI hydrocarbons were mixed with each other, or cross-mixed with each of the 4 categories of ARO hydrocarbons. The resulting cytotoxicity and IL-8 production from HEK were evaluated at 24 hr. The results showed an antagonistic cytotoxic effect between ALI and ARO hydrocarbons in which ALI attenuated the degree of HEK mortality caused by the ARO hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the ARO hydrocarbons reduced the significant increase of IL-8 induced by ALI hydrocarbons. Synergistic effects between low IL-8 inductive and low cytotoxic hydrocarbons were found and the highest cytotoxic and IL-8 inductive responses did not completely correspond to the mixture of highly cytotoxic and highly IL-8 inductive hydrocarbons. This study supports the concept that the ARO dictate the degree of HEK mortality, while the ALI are the major contributor to inciting the proinflammatory response. Mixture effects must be considered when evaluating cytotoxicity to HEK.",

In order to delineate the toxicological interactions among individual hydrocarbons in a mixture and their contributions to cutaneous toxicity, nine ALI and five ARO hydrocarbons were each divided into five (high/medium/low cytotoxic and strong/weak IL-8 induction) groups and intra/inter-mixed to assess for their mixture effects on HEK mortality and IL-8 release. Addition of single hydrocarbon to JP-8 fuel was also evaluated for their changes in fuel dermatotoxicity. The results indicated that when hydrocarbons were mixed, HEK mortality and IL-8 release were not all predictable by their individual ability affecting these two parameters. The lowest HEK mortality (7%) and the highest IL-8 production were induced with mixtures including high cytotoxic and weak IL-8 inductive ARO hydrocarbons. Antagonistic reactions not consistently correlated with ALI carbon chain length and ARO structure were evident and carried different weight in the overall mixture toxicities. Single addition of benzene, toluene, xylene or ethylbenzene for up to tenfold in JP-8 did not increase HEK mortality while single addition of ALI hydrocarbons exhibited dose-related differential response in IL-8. In an all ALI environment, no single hydrocarbon is the dominating factor in the determination of HEK cytotoxicity while deletion of hexadecane resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in IL-8 production. Overall, decane, undecane and dodecane were the major hydrocarbons associated with high cytotoxicity while tetradecane, pentadecane and hexadecane were those which had the greatest buffering effect attenuating dermatotoxicity. The mixture effects must be considered when evaluating jet fuel toxicity to HEK.",

The present studies with individual hydrocarbon (HC) constituents of JP-8 jet fuel shed light on this issue. To mimic occupational scenarios, JP-8, 8 aliphatic HC (nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane) and 6 aromatic HC (ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene, cyclohexyl benzene, naphthalene, dimethyl naphthalene) soaked cotton fabrics were topically exposed to pigs for 1 day and with repeated daily exposures for 4 days. Erythema, epidermal thickness, and epidermal cell layers were quantitated. No erythema was noted in 1-day in vivo HC exposures but significant erythema was observed in 4-day tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, and JP-8 exposed sites. The aromatic HCs did not produce any macroscopic lesions in 1 or 4 days of in vivo exposures. Morphological observations revealed slight intercellular and intracellular epidermal edema in 4-day exposures with the aliphatic HCs. Epidermal thickness and number of cell layers significantly increased (p < 0.05) in tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, and JP-8-treated sites. No significant differences were observed in the aromatic HC-exposed sites. Subcorneal microabscesses containing inflammatory cells were observed with most of the long-chain aliphatic HCs and JP-8 in 4-day exposures. Ultrastructural studies depicted that jet fuel HC-induced cleft formation within intercellular lipid lamellar bilayers of the stratum corneum. The degree of damage to the skin was proportional to the length of in vivo HC exposures. These data coupled with absorption and toxicity studies of jet fuel HC revealed that specific HCs (tridecane and tetradecane) might be the key constituents responsible for jet fuel-induced skin irritation.",

It has been identified in the emissions from volcanoes. The compound also occurs naturally in plants such as catmint, safflower and oreganos. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.43 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates n-decane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-decane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 35 hours. n-Decane has been detected in rain and snow samples suggesting that n-decane may be removed from the air by wet deposition. n-Decane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-decane is expected to have low  mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1500. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.15 atm-cu m/mole. n-Decane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation studies in soil have observed volatilization to be a more important removal process than biodegradation. Utilizing the OECD 301F test, 77-85.5% of Theoretical BOD was reached in 28-38 days indicating that n-decane is readily biodegradable and that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, n-decane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Die-away tests using sea-water from the Narragansett Bay and radio-labeled decane showed that 71-82% of the radio-labeled n-decane was mineralized to 14CO2 after 2.5 weeks. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 40 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to n-decane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-decane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-decane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing n-decane.

Biodegradation studies in soil have observed volatilization to be a more important removal process than biodegradation for n-decane(5,6). A 77-85.8% of theoretical biodegradation using activated sludge in several OECD 301F tests indicates n-decane is readily biodegradable(7) and suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.15 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.43 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.052 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.7 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 40(SRC), from its log Kow of 5.01(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). A 77-85.8% of theoretical biodegradation using activated sludge in several OECD 301F tests indicates n-decane is readily biodegradable(8) and suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Die-away tests using sea-water from the Narragansett Bay and radio-labeled decane showed that 71-82% of the radio-labeled n-decane was mineralized to 14CO2 after 2.5 weeks(9); volatilization removed only 6-15% of the hydrocarbon studied(9). n-Decane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

Vapor-phase n-decane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 35 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(3).

Loss of 13 and 52% of n-decane was observed within 5 and 15 days, respectively, from 1 mL of crude oil added to a 100 mL seawater solution collected at Fukae of Kobe harbor, Japan and incubated at 20 °C. Complete recovery was reported for all the control samples(1). Seawater from Narragansett Bay, US was spiked with (1-14C)n-decane; mass balance was calculated after 2.5 week experiments and showed that 71-82% of the radiolabeled n-decane has been mineralized to 14CO2.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Building materials such as petroleum based solvents such as floor adhesives and waxes, wood stains, polyurethane finish and air fresheners emit n-decane to indoor air(5). Average n-decane emissions from 2 ferry boats in the Skagerak-Kattegatt-Oresund (Denmark) Region were 13 and <0.1 mg/cu nm(6). n-Decane was detected in vapor from the Fresh Kills municipal solid-waste landfill in New York City(7). The n-decane concentration was reported in combination with para-dichlorobenzene as 13.97 ppmv(7). n-Decane was identified in the emissions from carpet cushions made of bonded urethane and prime urethane(8). Vapors from 2 domestic waste disposal sites in Augsburg and Munich, Germany and 2 sewage treatment plants in Munich were sampled and n-decane concentrations were 18.0-25.7 and  21.7-27.9 mg/cu m for the wastes disposal sites and 4.6-5.4 and 3.3-3.5 mg/cu m for the sewage treatment plants(9).",

Formation water contained n-decane at a concentration of 410 ug/L(2). Data from Sept 2, 1979 identified decane as a gaseous emission of the vehicle traffic through the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel of the Pennsylvania Turnpike(3). Data from Aug 25 to Sept 7, 1979 showed for a speed of 80 km/hr on straight and level highway, gasoline powered vehicles emitted n-decane at an average rate of 1.7 mg/km and diesel trucks emitted n-decane at an average of 7.2 mg/km(4). The average exhaust from 67 gasoline fueled vehicles was found to contain n-decane at a concentration 0.4% by weight of the fuel(5). Motorboats emitted n-decane to canal water with resultant concentration ranging from 4 to 19 ng/L with an average of 13 ng/L for 7 samples(6). Two n-decane concentrations were reported as 0.27 and 0.18 ug/cu m in the emissions of a municipal waste incineration plant(7). Concentrations of n-decane in primer and 3 interior alkyd enamel paints were found to be 30.7, 13.2, 23.4, 4.89 mg/g, respectively(8). The average n-decane emission rate for a copier in the idle and print modes was measured to be 12 and 450 ug/hr, respectively(9). The n-decane emission factor from the combustion of European beech, Pyrenean oak and black poplar in a domestic woodstove and fireplace ranged from 0.395 to 2.26 mg/kg fuel burned dry basis(10). Monitoring of exhaust from various diesel vehicles (model years 2007-2012) in China detected n-decane as 0.92-1.56% of the total VOCs(11). Based on 2004 monitoring (May 5, 8-12AM and May 6, 8-12AM) in road tunnels in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the average n-decane emission factor from motor vehicles was 50.7-421.5 g/kg(12). The n-decane emission from the tailpipe of gasoline-powered California vehicles was reported as 300 ug/km for a catalyst-equipped vehicle and 42,600 ug/km for a non-catalyst-equipped vehicle for a gasoline containing 1,120 ug n-decane/g(13).",

In 1983-4, the respective minimum, maximum and average outdoor air concentration of n-decane in northern Italy were less than 1, 10 and 3.1 ug/cu m(3). The same study determined the respective minimum, maximum and average indoor air concentration of n-decane for 14 homes and an office building were less than 2, 1100 and 92 ug/cu m(3). The concentration of n-decane in the downtown air of Zurich Switzerland was 1.6 ppb(4). At Deuselbach, Hunsruck in Germany, the atmospheric n-decane concentration was less than 0.01 ppb for October 23 1983(5). n-Decane was detected in the atmospheres of 6 industrialized cities of the USSR ranging in size of population from 0.4 to 4.5 million people(6-8). Concentrations of volatile organic compound exposure was measured for students commuting by bus and motorcycle in Taipei, Taiwan from January 24-30, 1992(9); median, maximum, and mean n-decane concentrations for in-bus and on-motorcycle measurements were 32.8, 101.7, and 38.9 ug/cu m and 28.6, 4.74.1, and 62.8 ug/cu m, respectively(9).",

The average time dispense gasoline during a self fill-up was found to be 1:43 minutes:seconds (3); n-decane concentrations in the ambient air ranged from 0.02 to 0.4 ug/cu m(3).",
